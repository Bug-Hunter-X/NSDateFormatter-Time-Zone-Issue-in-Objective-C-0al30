In Objective-C, a subtle error can occur when dealing with `NSDateFormatter` and time zones.  If you don't explicitly set the time zone for the date formatter, it might use the device's current time zone, leading to unexpected results when parsing or formatting dates received from a server or database with a different time zone. This is especially problematic when working with timestamps.  The issue might only manifest in specific regions or during daylight savings time transitions.
